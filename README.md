# advanced web scraper
 My attempt at a somwhat universal web scraper designed for sites with repetitive content

To install:

```
pipenv install
```

Create a folder called "drivers" within the working directory.

Download gecko driver here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Download firefox

Place both firefox and geckodriver in the drivers folder.

Run scraper.py
